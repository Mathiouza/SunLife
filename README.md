# SunLife

This is the repository for [SunLife's website](https://sunlifecomic.com). I wanted to make the code publicly visible to let people see the code and help me with the traduction.

## Build

To build the typescript projet, simply use the `tsc` command in the root folder that comes with typescript module in npm.

## Translation

You can help me translate the website in any languages. English is the most important of course, but you can share any translation you want.
You can also help me with translating the comic itself. Please start with posting something on the discussion tab.

## Code

You can open issues related to the website, like bugs or some other odd things that hapenning.

## Contact me

You can easily contact myself in the discussion tab, or on my different social media: [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/mathiouza) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mathiouza/). You can also send me an email: contact@sunlifecomic.com
